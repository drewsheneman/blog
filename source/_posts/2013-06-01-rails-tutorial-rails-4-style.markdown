For initially learning Ruby on Rails many prefer <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org" target="_blank">Rails Tutorial</a>, by Michael Hartl, which is available in full from his website, with great accompanying videos for purchase as well.

As an update, if you are interested in diving head first into Rails 4, I noticed there is now a <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book?version=4.0" target="_blank">Rails 4 Edition</a>. It also includes great updates to other techniques, such as in rspec replacing <a href="http://myronmars.to/n/dev-blog/2012/06/rspecs-new-expectation-syntax" target="_blank">'should' with 'expect'</a>, etc.
